## Commands and Concepts
> Any Git project will consist of three sections: 
> - The Git directory 
> - The working tree
> - The staging area.

## Git basic commands
> - `git init [repository name]`: This command is used to start a new repository.
> - `git clone [url]`: This command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.
> - `git add [file]`: This command adds a file to the staging area.
> - `git commit -m “[ Type in the commit message]”`: This command records or snapshots the file permanently in the version history.
> - `git commit -a`: This command commits any files you’ve added with the git add command and also commits any files you’ve changed since then.
> - `git status`: This command lists all the files that have to be committed.
> - `git log`: This command is used to list the version history for the current branch.
> - `git push [variable name] [branch]`: This command sends the committed changes of master branch to your remote repository.
> - `git pull [Repository Link]`: This command fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.
